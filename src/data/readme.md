This is where the "back-end" data will be temporarily stored. Data is immutable, of course, but it'll allow me to set-up the data consumption from the front-end before I make it on the back-end.

The `user.js` file is no longer in use, all information relating to users will be relayed through `users.json`, the file is being kept for the sake of future debugging.

`user.json` - Contains all information relating to the user.

**more files will be added as the need arises**
